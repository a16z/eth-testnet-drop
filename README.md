[![Telegram](https://img.shields.io/badge/Telegram-join%20chat-0088cc.svg)](https://t.me/ethereumtestnettokenclaim)
![UI](imgs/ui.png)
Repo contains a one-time claim for testnet tokens. The contract uses a merkle proof for set inclusion. The associated client guides the user through claiming on multiple networks and has some neat background physics.

## `cmds`
- `yarn install`
- `yarn test`
- `yarn start-local-backend`
- `yarn start-local-client`
- `yarn deploy-firebase`
- `yarn prod-serve`
- `yarn build-client`

## Dev workflow
1. Set up `DEV_WALLETS` environment variable â€“ comma separated list of wallets to prepopulate with test ETH.
2. Fill out `./contracts/data/local-mt.txt` with addresses for claiming.
3. Start local nodes: `yarn start-local-backend`
4. Start local client: `yarn start-local-client`
5. Add the local testnets to wallet (as described in `contracts/README.md`).
6. Navigate to `localhost:3000`, potentially clear nonces on wallet for test networks.
